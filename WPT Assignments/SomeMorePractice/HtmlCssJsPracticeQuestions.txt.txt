Here is a plain text file containing the 10 practice questions.


1. Simple Temperature Converter and Data Display
   1. Create a form with a single text input for a user to enter a temperature in *Fahrenheit*.
   2. Add a "Convert" button.
   3. Use JavaScript to validate that the input is a valid number.
   4. If the input is valid, convert the temperature to *Celsius* using the formula: C = (F - 32) * 5/9.
   5. Display the result on the page in a new paragraph below the form.
   6. If the input is not a valid number, display a descriptive error message on the page.

2. Student Grade Calculator with Object Storage
   1. Create a form with three input fields: **Student Name**, **Subject**, and **Score** (a number from 0 to 100).
   2. Define a JavaScript object named `studentGrades` to store the data.
   3. Add a button that, when clicked, updates the `studentGrades` object with the data from the input fields.
   4. Immediately below the input form, display the contents of the `studentGrades` object on the page. This display should update dynamically every time the button is clicked.
   5. Based on the score, add a new property to the object called `grade` and assign it a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).

3. Dynamic User Profile Generator
   1. Create a page with three text input fields: **City**, **Favorite Animal**, and **Lucky Number** (a single digit).
   2. On button click, use JavaScript to create a user profile ID following a specific set of rules: The first **three letters** of the City, the **middle two letters** of the Favorite Animal, and the **Lucky Number**.
   3. Display the generated profile ID in a large font on the page.
   4. Add a validation check to ensure all three input fields have content before generating the ID.

4. Simple Quiz with Score
   1. Create a quiz page with 3-5 multiple-choice questions.
   2. Use JavaScript to check the user's answers when a "Submit" button is clicked.
   3. Calculate the total score and display it on the page.
   4. Provide feedback on which questions were answered correctly and which were incorrect.

5. To-Do List Application
   1. Create an HTML page with an input field and an "Add" button.
   2. Use JavaScript to add new list items to an unordered list (`<ul>`) every time the "Add" button is clicked.
   3. Each list item should contain the text from the input field.
   4. Add a "Remove" button next to each list item that, when clicked, deletes that item from the list.

6. Image Gallery with Filters
   1. Create an image gallery using a set of images.
   2. Add buttons or links to filter the images by category (e.g., "Nature," "City," "Animals").
   3. Use JavaScript to show or hide images based on the selected filter.

7. Character Counter for a Text Area
   1. Create a `<textarea>` element for user input.
   2. Below the text area, add a counter that displays the number of characters the user has typed in real time.
   3. Set a maximum character limit and change the counter's color to red when the limit is exceeded.

8. Digital Clock
   1. Create a webpage with a dedicated area to display the time.
   2. Use JavaScript to get the current time.
   3. Update the display every second to show a real-time digital clock.

9. Interactive Form with Show/Hide Fields
   1. Create a form with a checkbox that says "I have a car."
   2. Initially, hide two input fields: **Car Make** and **Car Model**.
   3. Use JavaScript to show these two fields only when the checkbox is checked.
   4. Hide them again if the checkbox is unchecked.

10. Simple Calculator
    1. Create a basic calculator with buttons for digits (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /).
    2. Display the user's input in a text field.
    3. Use JavaScript to handle button clicks and perform the calculation when an "equals" button is pressed.
    4. Display the result in the same text field.
